## SLIDE-BY-SLIDE CONTENT (10 SLIDES MAX)

---

### SLIDE 1: TITLE
**Campaign Name:** SKIN IN THE GAME
**Tagline:** "Level Up Your Skin. Science-Backed."

**Visual:** Bold typography, CeraVe blue gradient, subtle gym/self-improvement imagery

**Speaker Notes:** This campaign targets a massively underserved market: Gen Z males entering skincare through the fitness and self-improvement lens. We call it "Skin in the Game" because CeraVe isn't just skincare—it's an investment in yourself.

---

### SLIDE 2: THE INSIGHT
**Headline:** The Looksmaxing Generation

**Key Points:**
- Gen Z males are entering skincare through **self-improvement culture**
- "Looksmaxing" = optimizing appearance for confidence (70M+ TikTok views)
- They trust **science and data** over beauty marketing
- Current skincare marketing ignores them (too feminine-coded)
- **Opportunity:** CeraVe's derm-backed positioning is PERFECT for this audience

**Data Points:**
- 38% of Gen Z uses skincare daily
- Male grooming market: $76B globally, growing 6% YoY
- "Looksmaxing" hashtag: 70M+ views on TikTok

**Visual:** Split screen - traditional skincare ad vs. gym/self-improvement aesthetic

---

### SLIDE 3: THE STRATEGY
**Headline:** The AG1 Playbook for Skincare

**Core Strategy:** Partner with **science-credible fitness influencers** (not beauty influencers) to position CeraVe as the "smart" skincare choice for guys who optimize everything.

**Three Pillars:**
1. **Credibility Partners** - Podcasters, fitness scientists, dermatologists
2. **Platform Native** - TikTok Shop, YouTube integrations, Reddit AMAs
3. **Education-First** - Teach the "why" (ceramides, barrier repair) not just the "what"

**Why This Works:**
- AG1 built a $1.2B brand through podcast credibility (Huberman, Rogan)
- CeraVe already has the science—we just need the right messengers
- Male Gen Z WANTS to learn, not be sold to

---

### SLIDE 4: THE CREATIVE CONCEPT
**Headline:** "The Skin Stack" Challenge

**Concept:** Frame CeraVe products as "the optimal skin stack"—borrowing language from supplements and fitness optimization.

**Mechanic:**
1. Fitness/looksmaxing creators share their "Skin Stack" (AM routine, PM routine)
2. Dermatologists "verify" the stack with science explanations
3. Viewers share their own stacks with #SkinStack
4. TikTok Shop integration for direct purchase

**The Hook:** "You optimize your supplements. You optimize your workouts. Why is your skin routine still random?"

**Michael Cera Callback:** Optional cameo where Michael Cera "tries to join the looksmaxing movement" but dermatologists remind him he didn't develop CeraVe

---

### SLIDE 5: PRODUCT INTEGRATION
**Headline:** The CeraVe Skin Stack

| Product | Stack Position | Messaging |
|---------|----------------|-----------|
| **CeraVe AM Lotion SPF 30** | Morning Essential | "SPF is non-negotiable. This is the minimum effective dose." |
| **CeraVe Moisturizing Cream** | Recovery Night | "Ceramides repair your barrier. Think of it as protein for your skin." |
| **CeraVe Healing Ointment** | Multi-Tool | "Lips, hands, dry patches. One product, maximum utility." |

**Visual:** Product lineup with fitness/optimization language overlays

**Why These Products:**
- Simple 3-product routine = accessible for skincare beginners
- Each serves a clear purpose = appeals to optimization mindset
- Affordable = removes barrier to entry
