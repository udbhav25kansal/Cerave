# CeraVe Haircare - FINAL PITCH DOCUMENT
## "SCALP IS SKIN" - One-Year Marketing Strategy

---

## CAMPAIGN CONCEPT

**Campaign Name:** SCALP IS SKIN
**Tagline:** "You care for your face. Now complete the routine."

**Core Insight:** Your scalp is skin—with 2x more oil glands and 10x more hair follicles than your face. Yet most people ignore it. CeraVe, the #1 dermatologist-recommended skincare brand, brings the same trusted ingredients to where your skin continues: above the hairline.

## ANSWERING THE 4 STRATEGIC QUESTIONS

### Q1: How can CeraVe differentiate in a saturated haircare market?

**The Differentiator:** CeraVe is the ONLY brand with #1 dermatologist-recommended skincare credibility extending to haircare.

| Competitor | Their Position | CeraVe's Advantage |
|------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Head & Shoulders | Anti-dandruff mass market | Not derm-developed, fragranced |
| Neutrogena | Skincare-to-hair crossover | Less brand equity in derm space |
| Premium brands | Luxury scalp treatments | $50+ price points vs. $9.97 |

**CeraVe's Unique Position:**
- Same ceramides, niacinamide, hyaluronic acid already trusted on faces
- Dermatologist-developed (not just recommended)
- Affordable derm-quality: $9.97
- Fragrance-free for sensitive scalps
- 450+ diverse scalps tested

---

### Q2: How can the brand position scalp health as an essential extension of skincare?

**Positioning Strategy: "Scalp Is Skin"**

**The Science:**
- Scalp = skin with hair
- Same barrier function, same needs
- Ceramides repair scalp barrier just like facial barrier
- Dandruff = scalp skin condition, not "hair problem"

**The Message:**
> "You wouldn't skip moisturizer on your face. Why skip it on your scalp?"

**Routine Extension Concept:**
```
FACE:  CeraVe Cleanser → CeraVe Moisturizer
       ↓ COMPLETE THE ROUTINE ↓
SCALP: CeraVe Shampoo → CeraVe Conditioner
```
