## Core Strategic Pillars (Use for All Responses)

### WINNING STRATEGY: "SKIN IN THE GAME"
Target the **looksmaxing/fitness male Gen Z** market with science-credible influencers (AG1 model).

### ICP (Ideal Customer Profile)
**Primary Target:** Gen Z Males, 16-24, North America
- New to skincare (NOT K-beauty experts)
- Into fitness, self-improvement, "looksmaxing"
- Trust science/data over aesthetic marketing
- Active on TikTok, YouTube, Reddit
- Influenced by gym influencers, podcasters, "alpha" creators

### 1. The AG1/Huberman Credibility Model
- Partner with science-credible fitness creators, NOT beauty influencers
- AG1 built $1.2B brand through podcast credibility
- CeraVe already has the science—we need the right messengers
- Male Gen Z wants to LEARN, not be sold to

### 2. The "Skin Stack" Positioning
- Frame CeraVe as "the optimal skin stack" (supplement/fitness language)
- Simple 3-product routine removes complexity for beginners
- "You optimize supplements. You optimize workouts. Why is your skin random?"

### 3. Product-Specific Angles (Fitness Language)
| Product | Stack Position | Messaging |
|---------|----------------|-----------|
| AM Lotion SPF 30 | Morning Essential | "SPF is non-negotiable. Minimum effective dose." |
| Moisturizing Cream | Recovery Night | "Ceramides repair barrier. Protein for your skin." |
| Healing Ointment | Multi-Tool | "Lips, hands, dry patches. Maximum utility." |

### 4. Platform Strategy Priorities
1. **TikTok** - Primary discovery + TikTok Shop (3.5x conversion)
2. **YouTube** - Long-form education, podcast ad reads
3. **Reddit** - r/SkincareAddiction, r/looksmaxing AMAs
4. **Instagram** - Amplification via Reels

### 5. Influencer Tiers
- **Tier 1 (Credibility):** Dr. Mike, Huberman-style creators, @DermDoctor
- **Tier 2 (Reach):** Gym/looksmaxing TikTokers, glow-up creators
- **Tier 3 (UGC):** Micro-influencers sharing their "Skin Stack"
