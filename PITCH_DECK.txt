SCALP IN THE GAME
"Your routine's been playing with half a roster."

CeraVe Haircare - One-Year Marketing Strategy

Market Opportunity:
- $14.73B scalp care market in 2025
- 19% YoY category growth
- 3.5x TikTok Shop conversion rate
- CeraVe is the #1 dermatologist-recommended skincare brand


================================================================================
SLIDE 2: THE INSIGHT - THE FOREHEAD FRONTIER
================================================================================

THE FOREHEAD FRONTIER

The Problem:
Skincare routines stop at the hairline like there's an invisible border.
But your scalp is skin—with 2x more oil glands and 10x more hair follicles
than your face. It's been ignored for too long.

Consumer Truth:
"Gen Z treats their face like a temple and their scalp like a parking lot."

The Gap:
- No brand owns "scalp = skincare" at mass retail prices
- 559K weekly TikTok views for #hairgrowth—people CARE about scalp
- CeraVe has the derm credibility—now cross the forehead frontier

Why Now:
"Skinification" is the fastest-growing haircare trend (19% YoY).
The market is ready. No affordable derm brand has claimed it.


================================================================================
SLIDE 3: THREE CAMPAIGNS, ONE MOVEMENT
================================================================================

THREE CREATIVE CAMPAIGNS

Each campaign targets a different entry point into the "scalp = skin"
conversation, building a layered content ecosystem.

CAMPAIGN 1: #SCALPINTHEGAME
Tagline: "Your routine's been playing with half a roster."
Hook: Sports/gaming language for the self-optimization crowd
Content: "Building my starting lineup" TikToks showing face → scalp routine
Audience: Gamers, sports fans, competitive types

CAMPAIGN 2: #ROOTACCESS
Tagline: "Unlock the source code of hair health."
Hook: Tech/hacker culture reference for ingredient-obsessed Gen Z
Content: Dermatologists explaining scalp biology like system architecture
Audience: Tech-savvy, ingredient readers, research-driven

CAMPAIGN 3: #FOREHEADFRONTIER
Tagline: "Skincare doesn't stop at the hairline."
Hook: Exploration/discovery language for self-care enthusiasts
Content: Before/after "expedition logs" showing scalp transformations
Audience: Self-care community, transformation seekers

WHY THREE CAMPAIGNS:
Different audiences respond to different languages.
Gamers hear "scalp in the game."
Tech-savvy see "root access."
Self-care explorers feel "forehead frontier."
Same message, three doors.


================================================================================
SLIDE 4: THE SCALP STACK - AG1 PLAYBOOK FOR HAIR
================================================================================

THE SCALP STACK: AG1 PLAYBOOK FOR HAIR

What's a "Stack"?
AG1 turned supplements into a "stack." We turn scalp care into the same.
It's not just shampoo—it's your Scalp Stack.

THE AG1 MODEL:
- Science-First: Huberman explains biology → credibility
- Routine Language: "Add to your stack" not "buy our product"
- Community: Sharing stacks becomes social currency
- Result: AG1 hit $1.2B with this playbook

CERAVE'S EDGE:
We already have the science credentials.
We already have the ingredients (ceramides, niacinamide, HA).
We just need to speak the language of optimization.

STACK CONTENT FORMATS:
1. "My Scalp Stack" TikTok - GRWM routine optimization flex
2. "Derm Rates My Stack" - Authority validation through duets
3. "30 Days of Root Access" - Before/after transformation proof
4. "The Stack vs. The Rest" - Competitive comparison content


================================================================================
SLIDE 5: INFLUENCER STRATEGY - THE CREATOR ECOSYSTEM
================================================================================

THE CREATOR ECOSYSTEM

Not just beauty influencers. We're building credibility through science,
fitness, and self-improvement creators who speak to the optimization mindset.

TIER 1: THE LAB COATS
Dermatologists & Trichologists
- Dr. Muneeb Shah (18M), @DermDoctor
- Science-first education: "Why ceramides work on your scalp"
- Credibility anchor for entire campaign

TIER 2: THE EXPLAINERS
Science Podcasters
- Huberman-style creators
- Long-form YouTube on scalp biology
- Podcast integrations (the AG1 model)
- "Root Access" content series

TIER 3: THE GRINDERS
Fitness & Looksmaxxing
- Gym TikTokers, glow-up creators
- Self-improvement angle: "You optimize everything else—why not your scalp?"
- Male Gen Z sweet spot (untapped skincare audience)

TIER 4: THE ARMY
UGC Creators
- Micro-influencers sharing their Scalp Stack
- Before/after content
- TikTok Shop affiliate links for trackable conversion

THE GYM/LOOKSMAXXING ANGLE:
Male Gen Z is the untapped skincare audience. They're already optimizing

and CeraVe becomes their first haircare brand.
