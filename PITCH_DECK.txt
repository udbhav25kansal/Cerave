SCALP IS SKIN
"You care for your face. Now complete the routine."

CeraVe Haircare - One-Year Marketing Strategy

Market Opportunity:
- $14.73B scalp care market in 2025
- 19% YoY category growth
- CeraVe is the #1 dermatologist-recommended skincare brand


================================================================================
SLIDE 2: THE CHALLENGE
================================================================================

CERAVE'S HAIRCARE MISSION

The 4 Strategic Questions:
1. How can CeraVe differentiate within a saturated haircare market?
2. How can the brand position scalp health as an essential extension of skincare?
3. Which innovations, partnerships, digital tools, and communication channels?
4. How can CeraVe increase awareness, trial, and long-term loyalty (18-35)?

THE OPPORTUNITY:
- Scalp care is the fastest-growing haircare segment (19% YoY)
- "Skinification" trend at mass retail tipping point in 2026
- CeraVe has unmatched dermatologist credibility to leverage


================================================================================
SLIDE 3: THE INSIGHT
================================================================================

YOUR SCALP IS SKIN

The Science:
- Scalp has 2x more oil glands than face
- Scalp has 10x more hair follicles
- Same barrier function, same ingredient needs

Consumer Truth:
"People who care about their skin don't realize their scalp IS skin."

The Gap:
No brand owns "scalp = skin" at accessible price points.


================================================================================
SLIDE 4: THE STRATEGY
================================================================================

"SCALP IS SKIN" CAMPAIGN

4 Strategic Pillars:

1. EDUCATE
   Teach consumers that scalp is skin and needs the same care as their face

2. EXTEND
   Position haircare as a natural routine extension, not a new category

3. VALIDATE
   Leverage dermatologist credibility and trusted skincare ingredients

4. ACCESSIBLE
   Deliver derm-quality scalp care at an accessible $9.97 price point

DIFFERENTIATION:
The ONLY #1 derm-recommended skincare brand in haircare
