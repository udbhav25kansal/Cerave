#### Category 2: Competitive Response Questions
| Likely Question | Defense Strategy |
|-----------------|------------------|
| "What if Head & Shoulders responds?" | Explain your differentiation is defensible; they can't claim dermatologist roots |
| "Why wouldn't consumers just stick with what they know?" | Cite consumer data on ingredient awareness, openness to new brands |

#### Category 3: Execution Questions
| Likely Question | Defense Strategy |
|-----------------|------------------|
| "How do you measure success?" | Refer to your metrics slide; have specific KPIs ready |
| "What's your biggest risk?" | Acknowledge honestly, then pivot to your mitigation strategy |

### Q&A RESPONSE FRAMEWORK:

3. **Connect** (5 seconds): Tie back to your strategy/CeraVe brand

**Example:**
> "That's a great question about budget allocation. We prioritized digital and influencer spend at 60% because our consumer research showed that 78% of our target demographic discovers new products through social media. This aligns with CeraVe's successful approach with the Michael Cera campaign, which leveraged social virality to drive massive awareness."
