## STRATEGIC IDEAS EXTRACTED

### 1. Scalp Care Expansion (Parking Lot)
- Scalp serum industry growing **2x faster** than shampoo/conditioner
- Could combine leave-on serums with CeraVe's ceramides + niacinamide
- **Status:** Interesting but outside product focus for this competition

### 2. Target Market Redefinition (ADOPTED)
**Original assumption:** Generic Gen Z skincare users
**New direction:** North American skincare **newcomers** (not K-beauty experts)

**Why this matters:**
- Korean skincare already dominates the "expert" Gen Z female market
- CeraVe can own the **beginner/newcomer** segment
- Especially: **Male Gen Z** entering through self-improvement lens

### 3. Gym/Looksmaxing Influencer Strategy (ADOPTED)
**Key quotes from discussion:**
> "We can go for gym influencer, looksmaxing... they'll just talk on TikTok live stream, 'Y'all look good, this is what I use.'"
> "Rather than going for beauty influencers, we can go for the gym kind of guy mentality, alpha male influencers."

**Strategy:**
- Target gym influencers, not beauty influencers
- Tap into "looksmaxing" and self-improvement culture
- Use TikTok Shop for direct purchase during live streams

### 4. AG1/Andrew Huberman Model (ADOPTED)
**Key quote:**
> "AG Greens with Andrew Huberman... he has a lot of credibility. Also lends up the science lens."

**Application:**
- Partner with science-credible podcasters/creators
- CeraVe's dermatologist backing = built-in credibility
- Education-first approach (like AG1 explaining ingredients)

### 5. Visual Mock-ups in Presentation (ADOPTED)
**Key quote:**
> "Instead of just saying, we actually show them graphics of posts, what exactly it would look like, how a UGC video would look like."

**Action:**
- Include mock-ups of TikTok videos, Instagram posts
- Show what influencer content would look like
- AI tools can help generate these visuals

### 6. TikTok Shop Integration (ADOPTED)
**Key quote:**
> "They can put it on their TikTok shop to buy it."

**Application:**
- TikTok Shop drives 3.5x more orders than average
- Direct purchase link during live streams and videos
- Trackable conversion metrics

## PRINCIPLES IDENTIFIED

### 1. Realistic & Implementable
> "We don't necessarily have to list anything about money, but it has to be able for them to make it happen if they want to do it."

**Implication:** Campaign should be actionable, not fantasy

### 2. Not Finance-Heavy
> "I don't think we're going to be finance heavy on this one. Marketing, marketing."

**Implication:** Focus on creative strategy, not detailed budgets

### 3. Answer the Four Questions
> "Focus on the more answering those four big questions that they wanted us to figure out first."

**The Four Judging Criteria:**
1. Innovation & Creativity (25%)
2. Audience Engagement (25%)
3. Brand Alignment (25%)
4. Measurability & Impact (25%)

### 4. Differentiation from K-Beauty
> "Just using the influencer is not enough 'cause there's so many Korean skin products doing it."

**Implication:** Need a unique angle (hence: gym/looksmaxing)
