                    CERAVE HAIRCARE - FINAL PITCH DOCUMENT
                    "SCALP IN THE GAME" - One-Year Marketing Strategy
================================================================================


CAMPAIGN CONCEPT
================================================================================

Campaign Name: SCALP IN THE GAME
Tagline: "Your routine's been playing with half a roster."

Core Insight:
Your scalp is skin—with 2x more oil glands and 10x more hair follicles than
your face. Yet most people ignore it. CeraVe, the #1 dermatologist-recommended
skincare brand, brings the same trusted ingredients to where your skin
continues: above the hairline.

Three Sub-Campaigns:
1. #ScalpInTheGame - Sports/gaming language for self-optimizers
2. #RootAccess - Tech/hacker culture for ingredient-obsessed Gen Z
3. #ForeheadFrontier - Explorer language for self-care enthusiasts


================================================================================
ANSWERING THE 4 STRATEGIC QUESTIONS
================================================================================


Q1: HOW CAN CERAVE DIFFERENTIATE IN A SATURATED HAIRCARE MARKET?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Differentiator:
CeraVe is the ONLY brand with #1 dermatologist-recommended skincare credibility
extending to haircare, combined with AG1-style optimization positioning.

Competitive Landscape:
+------------------+------------------------+--------------------------------+
| Competitor       | Their Position         | CeraVe's Advantage             |
+------------------+------------------------+--------------------------------+
| Head & Shoulders | Anti-dandruff mass     | Not derm-developed, fragranced |
| Neutrogena       | Skincare-to-hair       | Less brand equity in derm space|
| Premium brands   | Luxury scalp treatments| $50+ price points vs. $9.97    |
+------------------+------------------------+--------------------------------+

CeraVe's Unique Position:
- Same ceramides, niacinamide, hyaluronic acid already trusted on faces
- Dermatologist-developed (not just recommended)
- Affordable derm-quality: $9.97
- Fragrance-free for sensitive scalps
- 450+ diverse scalps tested
- "Scalp Stack" optimization positioning (AG1 playbook)


Q2: HOW CAN THE BRAND POSITION SCALP HEALTH AS AN EXTENSION OF SKINCARE?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Positioning Strategy: "Scalp In The Game"

The Science:
- Scalp = skin with hair
- Same barrier function, same needs
- Ceramides repair scalp barrier just like facial barrier
- Dandruff = scalp skin condition, not "hair problem"

The Message:
"Your routine's been playing with half a roster."
"You optimize everything else—why not your scalp?"

Routine Extension Concept:
    FACE:  CeraVe Cleanser --> CeraVe Moisturizer
                    |
           COMPLETE THE STACK
                    |
    SCALP: CeraVe Shampoo --> CeraVe Conditioner
